# BayesianLSTM-for-Time-series-Prediction
This repository is showing how to leverage Bayesian deep learning (in this case, LSTM) to do the one next-step time-series prediction with quantifying epistemic uncertainty and aleatoric uncertainty simultaneously.

The data used here is modified from the sunspot dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/robervalt/sunspots/data#
